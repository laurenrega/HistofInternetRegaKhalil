                With no one person in charge of it, the internet has no set invention date or inventor but rather is
                continuously evolving after engineers, computer scientists, and programmers. The idea behind creating
                the internet was to link multiple heterogeneous computers together and be able to share files among
                them. The internet continued to develop into something the inventors never imagined. It became the
                primary method of communication with people all around the world and later into world’s largest market
                place holding the most information in the world.

                ARPANET was created in the 1960s where mini computers or Interface Message Processors (IMPs) were use
                with packet switching as a method of electronically transmitting data across multiple computers. The
                “packets” were the data files and the team of scientist and engineers had to work together with the BBN
                team to determine how long these packets will last on the web and how the packets know where and how far
                to go. After being built at BBN for months, the first IMP was transported to UCLA to be tested in
                September 1969 and it worked.

                After a successful first run, the teams worked tirelessly to continue to improve this new form of
                communication. This led to the invention of electronic mail. E-mail was first invented by Raymond
                Tomlinson who developed the programming code that became e-mail. For over twenty years, the internet was
                only used for these two functions. In the 1990s when the World Wide Web was created. Websites and online
                data was becoming more and more accessible to the general public.
