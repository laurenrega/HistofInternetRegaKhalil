            <h2>The Dotcom Bubble </h2>
            <p>
Most people probably could not imagine consumerism today without ecommerce. Prior to the 1990’s, though, shopping was done exclusively through brick and mortar stores. Jeff Bezos and Pierre Omidyar had ideas around the same time that would revolutionize consumerism and have lasting effects on brick and mortar stores and the economy overall.
Bezos, the founder of Amazon, and Omidyar, the founder of eBay, both saw the internet as a place to do business. They were very different in their approaches, though. Bezos was very analytical and methodical about business plans, market research, etc. Omidyar was not as organized and just wanted to build a level marketplace where regular people could sell items and compete with the big corporations. Both companies grew much faster than their founders could have imagined. In fact, Wall Street quickly caught on to customer conversion to online shopping.
The explosion in online shopping was made possible by two principles—Moore’s Law and Metcalfe’s Law. Moore’s Law states that the speed and power of integrated circuits, from microprocessors to memory chips doubles every 18 months. This doubling helped to make transistors smaller and smaller, which is why computers have shrunk so quickly. Engineers consistently made smaller chips and always were improving. Metcalfe’s Law states that every node that is added to a network doe s not only increase the network by just plus one, the curve is actually much steeper. For example, 2 users equals 1 connection, 4 users equals 6 possible connections, and 10 users can have 45 pair connections! This means that the internet gathers momentum as it goes. As the number of users increases, usefulness of the network increases, which makes it even more compelling for new users to join. New encryption for the digital age also helped aid the explosion. Mathematicians developed public and private key cryptography, which allowed only the intended recipient to access sensitive information like credit card numbers.  This made internet transactions much more secure. By the mid 1990’s, the two laws along with encryption advancements were helping the internet grow exponentially.
Wall Street was enormously enthusiastic about this growth, but ignorant about the way that the internet worked and did not know much about Moore and Metcalfe’s Laws. This ignorance, enthusiasm, and greed created the perfect recipe for a financial bubble, which was the case with many previous innovations such as the automobile and the railroad system. In the mid 90’s many internet companies were going public. Amazon, for example, IPO’d in 1997 after just two years of business. This was controversial as Bezos did not have any profits yet. His mantra was to “Get Big Fast”, which was a critical strategy for growing Amazon. Bezos constantly lowered prices in order to grow and provide a better experience for customers, which would then lead to more growth. Wall Street was liking this strategy, especially former analyst Henry Blodget. He believed the stock would soar and created a stock-buying frenzy. This caused the price to double and began the manic bubble. eBay had similar success after they brought on Meg Whitman, a businesswoman from Disney that helped define the company.
The IPO’s made Bezos and Omidyar famous. Countless imitators migrated to Silicon Valley without experience or business plans and Venture Capitalists were investing tons of money. Meanwhile, Average Joe’s were able to become Day Traders in their own homes due to technology advancements. People were obsessively investing in internet companies. The VC’s were aware that many of these visionless companies were not going to make it, but they hedged their bets by investing in hopes that one investment in each category would strike big. The Wall Street money managers also believed that many of these companies would not survive. Blodget actually wrote those feelings down in emails which would later get him in trouble. The parallel Telecommunications bubble, in which companies were rapidly increasing bandwith also impacted the Dotcom bubble—companies were spending and building too much. In 2000, Alan Greenstan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve decided that the time had come to cool things down. The Reserve significantly raised interest rates twice in hopes of ending the bubble. Later, on Black Friday the Nasdaq dropped 355 points. There was a huge collapse and Nasdaq lost two thirds of its volume. The bubble had popped and Wall Street was blamed. In fact, Blodget was banned from the industry for life.
Although the bubble was not ideal, there were many great ideas sparked because of it. The heavy competition helped build out internet infrastructure very quickly. Amazon and eBay’s success also highlighted the importance of customer focus. Many companies that came out of the bubble failed, but those with a strong enough vision we
