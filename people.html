                After the Dotcom Bubble, a new wave of internet innovation began to sweep the web, known as the Era of Web 2.0. This new era was defined by one common theme—the ability of the people to contribute to the web in a meaningful way. The internet took the control of communications out of the hands of top media executives and placed them in the hands of the ordinary consumer.
Companies like YouTube and Digg were early leaders of the Web 2.0 revolution. They wanted to change the world through web enabled people power. For example, YouTube, an online video sharing site, allowed its users to create and view content, as stated in their slogan “Broadcast Yourself”. This took some power out of the hands of the TV media and into the hands of the consumers—who wanted to create and watch each other. Similar to YouTube, Digg also believed in the “wisdom of crowds”. This site was an online news forum, and allowed anyone to write a story. When stories were popular, people would “Digg” them, and the story would receive more prominence of the site. This took some power out of the hands of the few editors that would previously dictate what stories were fitting for a front page. Several other companies shook up the establishment industries as well.
Prior to YouTube and Diggs, one industry that was turned upside down was the music and recording industry. The process of purchasing CD’s from a store, which seems archaic now, had been outdated by the MP3, which made it easy to move compressed music back and forth throughout the net. The recording industry was in denial—they actually conducted a study with IBM that found that consumers would not want to burn their own CD’s. Ironically, another similar IBM study made a similar mistake about a decade earlier regarding consumer PC’s. Regardless of the study, music fans were finding and downloading music on their own. This new way of consuming music sparked an idea for Shawn Fanning, a college student who created Napster. Shawn desired an easy way to share their music collections, so he created Napster, the music sharing site that used a peer-to-peer architecture. At first, the founder just wanted to share the site with friends, but within a week the website had 10,000 users. Interest in the site continued to spread, and organically, Napster became a genuine web community where people shared views and expressed themselves. This posed a big threat to the establishment recording and music companies. The Recording Industry Association of America, which protects the music business, let Napster know that it was illegal to offer copywritten music for free on their site. It was large scale online theft. Top entertainment lawyers began riling up their largest musician clients because they wanted to ensure the protection of music and other intellectual property that could be threatened in the future. Lawsuits were filed against Napster and the website lost and was immediately shut down. This was a bittersweet victory because the music industry had targeted their customers as thieves, music fans. Although Napster did not last, it inspired Steve Jobs to create the Apple store, which was mutually beneficial for the labels as well as the consumers. Napster set a precedent for Big Media worrying about the internet—it opened up new markets that they were unable to control. As mentioned, people were entertaining themselves using YouTube rather than TV programming, and this posed a huge threat.
Social Networking also boomed after the Dotcom Crash. First Friendster, then Myspace and then Facebook came along, proving that internet users were hungry to communicate. Facebook was unique among the social networks popping up. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder, used the social graph concept, which describes that we are all bound together by a web of relationships. His company grew quickly and is widely used today.
Web 2.0 initialized a new age of human communication. People could socialize, post jobs, share their views, find love, and more without having to go through top-down establishment firms like before. It provided immense opportunity to everyone with an internet connection and sparked creativity and discussion. The internet continues to be used in this way and is only getting bigger, faster, and more social!
