                Initially the internet was thought to not be used by ordinary people, but rather scientist and
                engineers or “geeks”. This changed very quickly. The internet became a global network used by
                young. A computer scientist, Tim Benrers-Lee, invented the world wide web to give access to all.
                This
                led to the browser wars when the largest tech companies fought against each other to be the
                world’s
                most downloaded browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bill Gates started Microsoft which first launched Windows 95 and Internet Explorer as the
                largest
                web browser of the time. He quickly became the world’s tech emperor. Netscape in the meantime
                was
                working on battling ways that they can battle their top competitor with Mosaic. When Netscape
                launched their Netscape Navigator browser, it began growing very quickly as an overall platform,
                reaching a million downloads in a short period of time. Bill Gates back at Microsoft then began
                his
                journey to find a way to beat or destroy all competitors against their internet browser. After
                Netscape, many other competitors began to arise. This initiated the browser wars.

            <p>
                Netscape grew very quickly and when Microsoft realized this, they proposed a meeting with
                Netscape
                and offered them one million dollars for their company and all its resources. Netscape declined
                their offer as their realized the potential of their software, assets, and people. They were the
                first company to decline an offer from the largest leaders in tech.
            </p>
            <p>
                Microsoft believed their browser become irrelevant by Netscape’s technology and software. They
                attempted to attack Netscape as a way to defeat their largest competitor by releasing newer
                versions
                of their Windows browser and using “tech assassin” techniques to have large groups of people
                committed to only download Windows. This allowed their assets to grow significantly and catch up
                to
                Netscape. By 1997, the browser war ended when Microsoft defeated Netscape and became the leading
                browser, Internet Explorer, on the world wide web. After losing to Microsoft, Netscape quickly
                went
                under and was later acquired by AOL.
            </p>

                Following these events, Bill Gates became known as the high tech
                terrorist in Silicon Valley for his actions to keep his company at the top. Lawsuits were raised
                against Microsoft
                –
                the antitrust case of 1998. Bill Gates denied any accusations and was found guilty. Microsoft
                might have won the browser wars and became the leading browser for the following
                years,
                but the company lost its force after they were expose for how they got to where they were. This
                sparked a revolution and the start of companies such as google.
