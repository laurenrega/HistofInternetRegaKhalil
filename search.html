                Whether it is Google, Yahoo, or Safari, many cannot imagine life today without access to search engines
                on the internet. Search gives us access to an infinite volume of information at our fingertips. This was
                not always the case. Before developing the technology, software engineers and programmers had to work
                tirelessly to convince investors that it will bring in sufficient revenue but it did not take very long
                before they proved their success.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yahoo was created when two young electrical engineering students were looking for a way to win a
                Stanford University basketball league. They unknowingly took the first steps to “search”. Yahoo kicked
                off the web boom. Many startups began releasing new software and search engines, one of these being
                Excite which was founded by two tech-savvy Stanford students. The internet was booming and the
                competition was extremely high.
            </p>
            <p>
                Excite wanted to partner with Google’s search technology to surpass yahoo who was dominating the search
                engine nation. Google was still very new at the time but had impressive technology that Excite wanted
                access to but after comparing the two searches side by side, Excite decided not to move forward because
                they did not see the potential of search. In hindsight they regretted the decision of passing on
                purchasing Google for only one million dollars at the time. Google then went on to become one of leading
                search engines in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Revenue was a huge concern for Google’s investors because the site’s search page did not run ads but
                once they saw the potential and the range of audience the search engine was able to reach, investors
                quickly changed their minds. They then focused their work on mimicking the yellow pages in Search with
                tags and keywords. They attempted to collaboration with Overture but the two companies did not see
                eye-to-eye. Google then went to work on Adworks which was similar to the work Overture did. Overture
                then sued Google for copying their technology. Both companies eventually settled but it led to tension
                between them.

                Google went public in 2004 and their stocks rapidly grew to surpass Yahoo, Overture and every other
                search engine of the time. Nonetheless, they continue to grow and expand their margins to stay at the
                top to surpass their top competitors such Microsoft.
